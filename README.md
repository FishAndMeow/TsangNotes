# Dave's LaTeX Class Notes Template v1.0

David Tsang - D.Tsang@soton.ac.uk

2018/08/24

This is a template for skeletal class notes based on the tufte-book class.
Copy "TsangNotes.sty" and "TsangNotes.cls" into your local LaTeX directory.

     \documentclass[options..]{TsangNotes}

(see also Dave's Problem Set template: https://github.com/davtsang/TsangPS)


# Class Options:

  	skeletal : skeletal notes, sets text color of things in \p{...} to white
	          (except for align environment equation numbers).
		  Also uses un-annotated image from \pincludegraphics{...}{..}
		  (see below)

	full : force full notes, sets text color of things in \p{...} to red
	       (except for align environment equation numbers).
	       Also uses annotated image from \pincludegraphics{...}{...}

	accessible : sets all the text to sans serif, including equations

All other options will be passed to tufte-book (e.g. the ones for UK notes are usually "a4ppaer, openany, notoc")

If no TsangNotes class specific options are set, it will default to the "full" behaviour. As an alternative to the class options (for command line options and makefiles) you can set the definitions

	\def\student{}  in order to set skeletal notes on

	\def\accessible{} in order to set accessible fonts on

Note that the class options override the \defs above  if they conflict.

# Class Commands:

       \logo[offset]{PATH} sets the path to the logo file to load next to
       the title you can use the offset in length units (cm, pts etc)
       in order to shift the image up or down

       \coverimage[SCALE]{PATH} sets the background cover image for the
       title page. SCALE (with fixed aspect ratio) by a fraction of the
       page width
       
       \overtitle{OVERTITLE} sets the overtitle for the cover page
       \title{TITLE} sets the title for the cover page
       \undertitle{UNDERTITLE} sets the undertitle for the cover page

       \p{...} hides the text if the notes are the "skeletal" version
       (by setting text color to white). You can use this surrounding
       entire align environments, but the equation numbers will stay black.
       In the "full" version everything in \p{...} will appear red. 

       \pincludegraphics{unannotated_path}{annotated_path} places graphics
       that are either "unannotated_path" for "skeletal" version, or
       "annotated_path" for the "full" version. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THESE
       HAVE THE SAME BOUNDING BOXES/SIZE in order for the skeletal version
       to maintain the same layout as the full version. 

## tufte-book class commands
	
	\marginnote[OFFSET]{...} places a note in the margin with a particular vertical offset
	
	\sidenote[OFFSET]{...} places a sidenote with a corresponding label in the margin (replaces \footnote{})
	
	\begin{marginfigure}...\end{marginfigure} places a figure environment in the margin
	
	\begin{figure}...\end{figure} places a figure environment that spans the main text
	
	\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*} places a figure environment that spans the page

# Boxes

Several TikZ boxes are provided for displaying examples, exercises and
emphasis.

## mybox

	\begin{mybox}[width=WIDTH]{TITLE}

	...
	
	\end{mybox}

This provides an unnumbered box with heading: "TITLE" with a blue/ocean coloured border. The box has width \textwidth by default. Set this to \pagewidth if you want it to span the page. 

## examplebox

	\begin{examplebox}[width=WIDTH]{TITLE}

	...
	
	\end{examplebox}

This provides a numbered example box with heading: "Example CHAP.EXNUM: TITLE"
that is by default has width \textwidth. Set this to \pagewidth if you want it to span the page.


## exercisebox

	\begin{exercisebox}[width=WIDTH]{TITLE}

	...
	
	\end{exercisebox}

This provides a numbered example box with heading: "Exercise CHAP.EXERCISENUM: TITLE"
that is by default has width \textwidth. Set this to \pagewidth if you want it to span the page. This box has a red border.
